    <b>Sobel Edge Detector</b>

<b>Brief Description</b>
    The Sobel operator performs a 2-D spatial gradient measurement on an image 
    and so emphasizes regions of high spatial frequency that correspond to edges.
    Typically it is used to find the approximate absolute gradient magnitude at each point 
    in an input grayscale image.
    
<b>How It Works</b>
    In theory at least, the operator consists of a pair of 3Χ3 convolution kernels as shown in Figure 1.
    One kernel is simply the other rotated by 90°. This is very similar to the Roberts Cross operator.

    These kernels are designed to respond maximally to edges running vertically and horizontally relative to 
    the pixel grid, one kernel for each of the two perpendicular orientations. 
    The kernels can be applied separately to the input image, to produce separate measurements
    of the gradient component in each orientation (call these Gx and Gy). 
    These can then be combined together to find the absolute magnitude of
    the gradient at each point andthe orientation of that gradient. 
    The gradient magnitude is given by:
    
        <i>|G| = √Gx<sup>2</sup>Gy<sup>2</sup></i>

    Typically, an approximate magnitude is computed using:
    
        <i>|G| = |Gx| = |Gy|</i>
   
    which is much faster to compute.
    
    The angle of orientation of the edge (relative to the pixel grid) giving rise 
    to the spatial gradient is given by:
    
        θ = arctan(Gy/Gx)
    
    In this case, orientation 0 is taken to mean that the direction of maximum contrast 
    from black to white runs from left to right on the image,
    and other angles are measured anti-clockwise from this.
    
    Often, this absolute magnitude is the only output the user
    sees --- the two components of the gradient are conveniently computed 
    and added in a single pass over the input image using the
    pseudo-convolution operator shown in Figure 2.

    Using this kernel the approximate magnitude is given by:
    
        <i>|G| = |(P<sub>1</sub>+2×P<sub>2</sub>+P<sub>3</sub>| - (P<sub>7</sub>+2×P<sub>8</sub>+P<sub>9</sub>)| + |(P<sub>3</sub>+2×P<sub>6</sub>+P<sub>9</sub>| - (P<sub>1</sub>+2×P<sub>4</sub>+P<sub>7</sub>)|</i>

<b>uidelines for Use</b>
    The Sobel operator is slower to compute than the Roberts Cross operator,
    but its larger convolution kernel smooths the input image to a greater extent and so makes 
    the operator less sensitive to noise.
    The operator also generally produces considerably higher output values for similar edges, 
    compared with the Roberts Cross.
    
    
    As with the Roberts Cross operator, output values from the operator can easily overflow 
    the maximum allowed pixel value for image types that
    only support smallish integer pixel values (e.g. 8-bit integer images).
    When this happens the standard practice is to simply set overflowing output pixels 
    to the maximum allowed value.
    The problem can be avoided by using an image type 
    that supports pixel values with a larger range.
    
    Natural edges in images often lead to lines in the output image that are several pixels wide 
    due to the smoothing effect of the Sobel operator.
     Some thinning may be desirable to counter this. Failing that, 
    some sort of hysteresis ridge tracking could be used as in the Canny operator.

<b>Common Variants</b>
    A related operator is the Prewitt gradient edge detector 
    (not to be confused with the Prewitt compass edge detector).
    This works in a very similar way to the Sobel operator but uses slightly different kernels, 
    as shown in Figure 3.
    
    This kernel produces similar results to the Sobel, but is not as isotropic in its response.
