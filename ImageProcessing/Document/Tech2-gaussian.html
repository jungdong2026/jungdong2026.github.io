<b>Brief Description</b>
    The Gaussian smoothing operator is a 2-D convolution operator 
    that is used to `blur' images and remove detail and noise.
    In this sense it is similar to the mean filter, 
    but it uses a different kernel that represents the shape of a Gaussian
    (`bell-shaped') hump. This kernel has some special properties which are detailed below.

<b>How It Works</b>
    The Gaussian distribution in 1-D has the form:

    where  <i>σ</i> is the standard deviation of the distribution. 
    We have also assumed that the distribution has a mean of
    zero <i>(i.e. it is centered on the line x=0)</i>. 
    The distribution is illustrated in Figure 1.

    In 2-D, an isotropic <i>(i.e. circularly symmetric)</i> Gaussian has the form:

    This distribution is shown in Figure 2.

    The idea of Gaussian smoothing is to use this 2-D distribution 
    as a `point-spread' function, and this is achieved by convolution.
    Since the image is stored as a collection of discrete pixels 
    we need to produce a discrete approximation to the Gaussian
    function before we can perform the convolution.
    
    In theory, the Gaussian distribution is non-zero everywhere,
    which would require an infinitely large convolution kernel, 
    but in practice it is effectively zero more than about three standard
    deviations from the mean, and so we can truncate the kernel at this point. 
    Figure 3 shows a suitable integer-valued
    convolution kernel that approximates a Gaussian with a  σof 1.4.

    Once a suitable kernel has been calculated, 
    then the Gaussian smoothing can be performed using standard convolution methods.
    The convolution can in fact be performed fairly quickly 
    since the equation for the 2-D isotropic Gaussian shown
    above is separable into <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components.
    
    Thus the 2-D convolution can be performed by first convolving
    with a 1-D Gaussian in the <i>x</i> direction, 
    and then convolving with another 1-D Gaussian in the <i>y</i> direction.
    (The Gaussian is in fact the only completely circularly symmetric operator 
    which can be decomposed in such a way.)
    
    Figure 4 shows the 1-D x component kernel 
    that would be used to produce the full kernel shown in Figure 3.
    The <i>y</i> component is exactly the same but is oriented vertically.

    A further way to compute a Gaussian smoothing with a large standard deviation is to convolve
    an image several times with a smaller Gaussian. 
    While this is computationally complex, it can have applicability
    if the processing is carried out using a hardware pipeline.
    
    The Gaussian filter not only has utility in engineering applications.
    It is also attracting attention from computational biologists 
    because it has been attributed with some amount of biological plausibility,
    e.g. some cells in the visual pathways of the brain often have an approximately Gaussian response.
    
    The effect of Gaussian smoothing is to blur an image, in a similar fashion to the mean filter.
    The degree of smoothing is determined by the standard deviation of the Gaussian.
    (Larger standard deviation Gaussians, of course, 
    require larger convolution kernels in order to be accurately represented.)
    
    The Gaussian outputs a `weighted average' of each pixel's neighborhood, 
    with the average weighted more towards the value of the central pixels.
    This is in contrast to the mean filter's uniformly weighted average. Because of this,
    a Gaussian provides gentler smoothing and preserves edges better than a similarly sized mean filter.
    
    One of the principle justifications for using the Gaussian as a smoothing filter is due to its frequency response.
    Most convolution-based smoothing filters act as lowpass frequency filters. T
    his means that their effect is to remove low spatial frequency components from an image. 
    The frequency response of a convolution filter, i.e. its effect on different spatial frequencies,
    can be seen by taking the Fourier transform of the filter.
    
    Figure 5 shows the frequency responses of a 1-D mean filter with width 7 and
    also of a Gaussian filter with  <i>σ= 3</i>.

    and Gaussian filter <i>( σ= 3 pixels)</i>.
    The spatial frequency axis is marked in cycles per pixel, 
    and hence no value above 0.5 has a real meaning.

<b>Guidelines for Use</b>
    Both filters attenuate high frequencies more than low frequencies, 
    but the mean filter exhibits oscillations in its frequency response.
    The Gaussian on the other hand shows no oscillations. 

    In fact, the shape of the frequency response curve is itself (half a) Gaussian.
    So by choosing an appropriately sized Gaussian filter we can be fairly confident 
    about what range of spatial frequencies are still
    present in the image after filtering, which is not the case of the mean filter.
 
    This has consequences for some edge detection techniques,
    as mentioned in the section on zero crossings. 
    (The Gaussian filter also turns out to be very similar to the optimal
    smoothing filter for edge detection under the criteria used to derive the Canny edge detector.)
