<b>Non-Linear Filters</b>
    A variety of smoothing filters have been developed that are not linear.
    While they cannot, in general, be submitted to Fourier analysis,
    their properties and domains of application have been studied extensively.

    * <i>Median filter </i>- 
    The median statistic was described in Section 3.5.2.
    A median filter is based upon moving a window over an image (as in a convolution)
    and computing the output pixel as the median value of the brightnesses within the input window.

    If the window is <i>J Χ K</i> in size we can order the <i>J * K</i> pixels in brightness value
    from smallest to largest. 

    If <i>J</i>*<i>K </i>is odd then the median will be
    the (<i>J</i>*<i>K</i>+1)/2 entry in the list of ordered brightnesses. 

    Note that the value selected will be exactly equal to one of the existing brightnesses so that 
    no roundoff error will be involved if we want to work exclusively with integer brightness values.
    
    The algorithm as it is described above has a generic complexity per pixel of <i>O(J*K*log(J*K))</i>.
    
    Fortunately, a fast algorithm (due to uang et al. ) exists that 
    reduces the complexity to <i>O(K) assuming J ≥ K</i>.
    
    A useful variation on the theme of the median filter is the <i>percentile filter</i>.

    Here the center pixel in the window is replaced not by the 50%
    (median) brightness value but rather by the <i>p</i>% brightness value where
    <i>p</i>% ranges from 0% (the <i>minimum filter</i>) to 100% (the <i>maximum filter</i>).
    Values other then (<i>p</i>=50)% do not, in general, correspond to smoothing filters.

    * <i>Kuwahara filter </i>- 
    Edges play an important role in our perception ofimages (see Figure 15) 
    as well as in the analysis of images. 

    As such it isimportant to be able to smooth images without disturbing the sharpness and,
    if possible, the position of edges.

    A filter that accomplishes this goal is termed an <i>edge-preserving filter</i> 
    and one particular example is the Kuwahara filter .
    
    Although this filter can be implemented for a variety of different window shapes, 
    the algorithm will be described for a square window of size <i>J = K = 4L + 1 where L</i> is an integer. 
    The window is partitioned into four regions as shown in Figure 29.

            Figure 29: Four, square regions defined for the Kuwahara filter. In
            this example <i>L</i>=1 and thus <i>J</i>=<i>K</i>=5. Each region is [(<i>J+1)/2] Χ [(K+1)/2].</i>
            
    In each of the four regions (<i>i=1,2,3,4)</i>, the mean brightness,
    <i>m<sub>i</sub></i> in eq. , and the <i>variance<sub>i</sub></i>,
    <i>s<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup></i> in eq. , are measured. 

    The output value of the center pixel in the window is the mean value of that 
    region that has the smallest variance.
