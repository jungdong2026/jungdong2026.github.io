Never met a girl could make me feel the way that you do
you're alright
whenever i'm asked what makes a my dreams real
i tell 'em you do
you're outta' sight
Well twiddley dee, twiddley dum
look out baby 'cause here i come
I'm bringing you a love that's true
get ready, get ready
start makin' love to you
get ready, get ready
get ready, 'cause here i come
get ready, 'cause here i come
You wanna' play hide and seek with love, let me remind you
you're alright
lovin' you're gonna' miss, and the time it takes to find you
you're outta' sight
well fee fi, fo fo fum
look out baby, 'cause here i come
I'm bringing you a love that's true
get ready, get ready
start makin' love to you
get ready, get ready
get ready, 'cause here i come
get ready, 'cause here i come
Baby all my freedoms should you want me to i think i'll understand
you're alright
hope i get to you before they do, 'cause that's how i planned it
you're outta' sight
Well twiddley dee, twiddley dum
look out baby 'cause here i come
I'm bringing you a love that's true
get ready, get ready
start makin' love to you
get ready, get ready
get ready, 'cause here i come
get ready, 'cause here i come
